# Orange_Code

*A high-level, object-oriented language that runs on just about any platform with a python interpreter.*

## Getting Started

To download, copy the orange_code folder to your python's Lib library. You can then use the terminal and runner versions (found in the terminal and runner folders) to run orange_code by running their respective .py files.

## Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;Orange_code is a programming language where most traditional programming structures have been turned into classes. Methods are represented as classes; primitive datatypes are represented as classes, which means that strings or numbers can be given their own state variables; and tables, if statements, while loops, and for loops, are all represented as classes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Another goal of orange_code is to make everything as editable as possible. Basic functions of primitive variables (e.g. and, plus, etc.) can be modified; method code can be changed after the creation of the method; and the method to get a certain variable can be modified.


*btw will add documentation on how to actually use it later :)*
